Firewall Rules Simulation: Theory Document

1. Introduction to Firewalls

A firewall is a security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules. It acts as a barrier between a trusted internal network and an untrusted external network, such as the internet. Firewalls are crucial for preventing unauthorized access and protecting networked systems from malicious threats.

Firewalls can be categorized into:

- **Packet Filtering Firewalls**: Inspect packets based on rules and either allow or block them.
- **Stateful Inspection Firewalls**: Keep track of active connections and decide packet forwarding based on connection state.
- **Proxy Firewalls**: Act as intermediaries between users and services.
- **Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFWs)**: Include features like intrusion prevention, deep packet inspection, and malware filtering.

2. How Firewall Rules Work

Firewall rules define what network traffic is permitted or denied. These rules are typically based on the following parameters:

- **Source IP Address**: The IP address where the packet originates.
- **Destination IP Address**: The IP address where the packet is headed.
- **Port Number**: The specific network service (e.g., HTTP on port 80, HTTPS on port 443).
- **Protocol**: The communication protocol (e.g., TCP, UDP, ICMP).
- **Action**: The decision to **ALLOW** or **DENY** the packet.

Example firewall rules:

- ALLOW packets from `192.168.1.1` to `ANY` on port `80` using protocol `TCP`.
- DENY packets going to `8.8.8.8` (Google DNS) from `ANY`.

3. Purpose of the Firewall Rules Simulation Program

The purpose of this **firewall rules simulation program** is to demonstrate how a firewall applies rules to network packets. The program:

1. Allows users to define custom firewall rules.
2. Generates **random network packets** with different source/destination IPs, ports, and protocols.
3. Allows users to **manually input packets** to test the firewall rules.
4. Checks whether a packet is allowed or denied based on the user-defined rules.
5. Displays results dynamically in a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**.

4. Implementation Details

4.1 Components of the Program

- **Packet Class**: Represents a network packet with properties like source IP, destination IP, port, and protocol.
- **Firewall Rule Class**: Defines rules and checks if a packet matches a rule.
- **Random Packet Generation**: Generates random packets with different attributes.
- **Firewall Rule Application**: Evaluates packets against firewall rules to determine whether they should be allowed or denied.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Built using **Tkinter**, allowing users to input rules and packets.

4.2 Features of the Program

- **Manual Packet Entry**: Users can enter a packet's details and check if it's allowed or denied.
- **Random Packet Simulation**: Automatically generates packets at regular intervals to test firewall rules.
- **Dynamic Firewall Rule Addition**: Users can add new rules through the GUI.
- **Real-time Output Display**: The program logs decisions for every packet processed.

5. How the Program Works

1. The program starts with a **set of default firewall rules**.
2. Users can **add custom rules** through text fields in the GUI.
3. Packets are either **randomly generated** or **manually entered** by the user.
4. Each packet is checked against the firewall rules.
5. If a matching rule is found, the packet is **allowed** or **denied** based on the rule's action.
6. If no rule matches, the packet is **denied by default**.
7. Results are displayed in real-time in the **GUI output log**.

6. Example Scenario

6.1 Example Firewall Rules

- Rule 1: Source IP: `192.168.0.1`, Destination IP: `ANY`, Port: `80`, Protocol: `TCP`, Action: ALLOW
- Rule 2: Source IP: `ANY`, Destination IP: `8.8.8.8`, Port: `ANY`, Protocol: `ANY`, Action: DENY
- Rule 3: Source IP: `ANY`, Destination IP: `ANY`, Port: `22`, Protocol: `TCP`, Action: ALLOW

6.2 Example Packet Processing

- **Packet 1**: `{'source_ip': '192.168.0.1', 'dest_ip': '192.168.0.2', 'port': 80, 'protocol': 'TCP'}`  
  Matches Rule #1 → **ALLOWED**

- **Packet 2**: `{'source_ip': '10.0.0.1', 'dest_ip': '8.8.8.8', 'port': 53, 'protocol': 'UDP'}`  
  Matches Rule #2 → **DENIED**

- **Packet 3**: `{'source_ip': '172.16.0.1', 'dest_ip': '192.168.0.2', 'port': 22, 'protocol': 'TCP'}`  
  Matches Rule #3 → **ALLOWED**

7. Conclusion

This project provides a hands-on demonstration of how firewalls operate and apply rules to network traffic. By allowing users to define rules and test packets, it offers insight into network security mechanisms used in **real-world firewall applications**. This simulation is a foundation for more advanced **cybersecurity projects**, such as **stateful firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and network security automation**.
